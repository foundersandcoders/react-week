### React docs

There's a lot more information in the React docs than we could cover in the course. Definitely have a read through and see what else you can do. For example here's the section on [error boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html).

The docs also have a few good articles about general React philosophy:
- [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
- [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

### General concepts

You have propably encountered the "prop drilling" problem by now (passing state/function down through multiple levels of components. [This article](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/prop-drilling-bb62e02cb691) by Kent C. Dodds gives a good overview.
He also has a good one discussing the [state of state management](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/application-state-management-66de608ccb24) in React right now (spoiler: you probably don't need Redux yet)

## Videos

- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) is what a lot of our Intro to the React API workshop was based on. It's great to quickly jump through to brush up on concepts.
- [Advanced React](https://courses.totalreact.com/p/advanced-react-free) is a great short series of videos introducing some more advanced React patterns (by the creator of React Router).
- [Advanced Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) goes into more depth about advanced React use.
