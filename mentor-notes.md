# Mentor Notes
## Day 1

### [Intro to ES6 Classes](https://github.com/oliverjam/es6-class-intro)
### [Reactive Rendering Challenge](https://repl.it/@sofiapoh/class-morning-challenge)
- explain that this challenge highlights the problem that react is trying to solve aka it's difficult to hold state and dynamically update the dom with vanilla js/jquery
- meant to be run as a morning challenge. It's okay for students to try to hack together a solution to get this to work
### [Modern frontend & how React fits in](https://hackmd.io/p/SJauYz6EM#) (talk/discussion)
- do the presentation
### [React API](https://github.com/oliverjam/intro-react-workshop) 
- go through each in turn and get students to read/complete exercise, then talk through their solutions

1. **Step1**
